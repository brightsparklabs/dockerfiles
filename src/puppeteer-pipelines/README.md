This image is effectively a fork of `razorcreationsltd/puppeteer-pipelines` that uses a newer version of `node` as the
base image. See the `Dockerfile` here: `https://github.com/razorcreations/puppeteer-pipelines`.

We use this image as part of our Bitbucket Pipelines to build node applications that depend on `puppeteer`.
